July 2024 FST Film Quote Quiz Javascript Application
Intructions:
You have 30 seconds to prove you know your Rhett Butler from your Jack Torrence.

Once you hit start/play/other the quiz will run through famous movie quotes.

Each quote will have three possible films to select, and it’s down to you to choose the right one.

Once you click on an answer, there is no going back so make sure you’re happy with your choice.

Each correct answer gets a point, each wrong answer, well, better luck next time.

Keep going until the timer runs out, or the questions run out (NOT BLOODY LIKELY!)

With that all said and done, you’ve gotta ask yourself a question: “Do I feel lucky?”….Well, do ya, punk?
